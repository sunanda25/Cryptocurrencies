# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for their customers. Martha, a senior manager for the advisory services team was asked to create a report about what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they can be grouped to create a classification system for new investment. 

Since there is no known output to look for, unsupervised machine learning is used to discover unknown patterns. A clustering algorithm is used to group the cryptocurrencies and data visualization is used to share the findings.
